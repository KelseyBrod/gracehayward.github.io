            <pre>  </pre>
                <p>I was born in New Jersey and lived there until I turned 16. The summer before my freshman year of high school, my family relocated to Boston, MA to accomodate my dad's new job. While I grew up in Jersey, I was always a Boston sports fan since my dad grew up in Amherst, MA and attended Boston College for undergrad. Moving excited rather than saddened me. I could not wait to be closer to my cousins, grandparents, and Fenway Park :) One of my favorite assignments from high school entailed writing a piece about a place I love. I wrote about my grandparents cottage on Cape Cod...</p>

<b><center>Cousin Cottage</center></b>
<pre> </pre>
Sandwiched between Brant Island Cove and Mattapoisett Harbor is the quaint town of Antassawamock. Six roads—no more than half a mile long each—bisect the main road perpendicularly. Musky cottages encased in weathered gray shingles huddle amidst heat burnt grass. Zigzagging bicycle tire tracks stain the crackling pavement. Permanently perched precariously along draping coils of telephone wire, flocks of starlings whistle in harmony. A deflated buoy swing, faded with time, oscillates in the side-yard of 28 Antassawamock Rd. The house itself is old yet sturdy. Flower boxes overflowing with pink and purple petunias adorn the screenless windows on either side of the front door. A round stained glass window hovers above the entrance; the victorian tulip glints in the summer sunlight. Inside, four rooms comprise the almost 1,000 square foot frame (not including the screened-in porch that protrudes from the side of the house). The wooden floorboards bear decades of scrapes and scratches, emblematic of the cherished memories etched into the very fabric of the household.

A purple, plastic fly swatter hangs from a hook above the metal waste bin in the corner of the kitchen. Next to that stands a yellowing, compact, double-door refrigerator covered in postcards, family photos, newspaper clippings, and the weekly tide schedule pinned with a combination of sea-shell and butterfly magnets. Wooden cupboards suspended above an L-shaped strip of linoleum countertops house the extent of the dining plates and bowls—most of which are hand-painted. A rusting coffee pot and two 16 ounce mason jars filled with blue-green sea glass decorate the otherwise bare countertops. Above the 3-burner propane stovetop, a collection of pastel-colored potholders dangle aimlessly from a hook made to look like a fishing rod. Overhead, a vintage ceiling fan hangs; five wooden blades slice through the muggy air. 
Susan Hayward, known as “Nana” to almost everyone within the boundaries of Antassawamock, hovers over the stove cloaked in a floral, ruffled apron. 
“Grandpa—gonna be a good batch today!”
Sitting on the front burner rests a medium-sized pot; a slab of butter sizzles. Now infused with buttery deliciousness, the pot awaits the infamous “Potcake” batter which—although similar in ingredients to pancake batter—is poured into a pot instead of a pan; this distinction is of utmost importance to not just Nana and Grandpa, but the entire lineage of potcake-loving Haywards. Whisk in hand, Grandpa stands beside Nana, combining the ingredients in a large, red mixing bowl. 
“Get ready—they’ll be here any minute now.”
The table, set with Nana’s signature watercolor ceramic dishes, emanates warmth. Ribbons of sunlight slicing through the half-opened window above the sink coexist with the familiar smell of searing potcakes to generate an unceasing, homey atmosphere. The serene nature of the kitchen is soon interrupted by a stampede of grandchildren, squealing with delight. Six girls and three boys make nine total, all of which are under the age of twelve. Skipping around the circular breakfast table, the children chant enthusiastically: “Potcakes, hotcakes, better than pancakes. Yummy, fluffy, batter-y, and buttery, we want Potcakes!” Grandpa, swinging the whisk in a circular motion, acts as if he is a choir-conductor; the chanting continues. Chuckling to herself, Nana carries a steaming stack of potcakes to the table. A tower of ten golden rounds of pure delectability awaits the hungry hands of the Hayward grandchildren. 
“Mmmmm,” all nine hum in unison. 
Undoubtedly, every last potcake is devoured; the food comas are in full swing. After tightening her apron, Nana pulls on her blue rubber dishwashing gloves and prepares to tackle a mountain of syrup-covered dishes. One-by-one, the grandchildren get up to clear their plates before retiring to the tv room. It is not long before Total Drama Island (a cartoon parody of the reality tv show Survivor) echoes from the porch.

A wicker sofa with plump white cushions is situated ten feet from a small, 80s television set. Pale, coral throw pillows are scattered lazily across the couch. Above the t.v. screen hangs a collection of family portraits and Nana’s beloved glass, sand dollars upholstered with metal tacks. A frayed, rainbow spiraled area rug blankets the creaky uneven planks; without it, splinters would be rampant. The bookshelf in the corner holds seemingly unending stacks of board games; Mattapoisett-opoly is the go-to. Sun peeks through the windows of the screened-in porch, projecting a soft glow onto the faces of Isabel, Charlotte, Megan, and Samantha, who sit hip-to-hip on the sofa. On the ground, Dylan, Olivia, and Grace engage in a heated round of rock-paper-scissors. Max and Will, the eldest of the grandchildren, steel two cushions from the sofa and sprawl out in the middle of the room. The Total Drama Island theme song reverberates around the room. In the background, the sound of Grandpa vacuuming thrums in their ears. At just five years old, Isabel (the youngest) finds it difficult to sit for an entire episode. 
“Can we go to the bunk room? Who wants to make bracelets?”
Pleading with Megan and Charlotte and tugging at Samantha’s arm, Isabel easily convinces them; the four girls scurry to the bunk room. Olivia and Grace follow shortly after. Skipping back through the kitchen, they make their way to the other end of the cottage—each stopping to give Nana and Grandpa hugs.

Four bunk beds, two floor lamps, and a rustic, whitewash dresser fill the small room. Each grandchild’s handprints and footprints (stamped at birth) hang on the wall. Turquoise and white striped sheets hug the eight twin mattresses, and several lightweight, cotton blankets speckle the ground. Pillowcases, decorated with starfish and seahorses, contribute to the beachy theme. The dresser, stuffed with bathing suits, swim shirts, Mattapoisett road race t-shirts, and sports shorts, holds only the essentials. On top of the dresser, a Ziploc bag bursts with multi-colored, friendship-bracelet string. Grabbing the scissors, Megan begins to cut the yarn.
“What colors does everyone want?”
One at a time, Megan distributes the trimmed strips of string. Olivia and Grace—the designated knot-tyers—twist and loop the ends of each bracelet. Forming a circle, the six girls start on their intricate designs. Isabel, still learning the art of bracelet-making, observes the rest in awe. Shuffling over to the dresser, Grace snatches the ‘cousin tablet’ from the dresser and plants it in the middle of the circle. 
“Let’s play some music!”
Turning the volume up, Olivia hits the play button.
“Everyone get ready,” she screams giddily. 
You Belong with Me by Taylor Swift booms from the tablet, producing sound waves that travel through the whole house. Harmonizing, the girls belt out the lyrics; it’s one of the many Swift songs they all know by heart. By the end, their voices are hoarse. Nevertheless, Samantha gestures to play it again.
“One more time! This time, let’s dance!”
Excitedly, the girls abandon their bracelets. Clutching greasy bottles of spray sunscreen, they passionately sing into the makeshift microphones and launch into a full-blown musical performance. Megan, Olivia, and Grace, the eldest of the girl cousins and lead singers, stand next to each other, yelling the lyrics in chorus. Isabel, Samantha, and Charlotte, the younger trio, serve as backup dancers, swaying and twirling energetically. The cycle of singing and bracelet-making repeats until Nana calls from the bathroom. 
“Girls, I have a surprise for you!”
Consumed with curiosity and elation, Megan, Isabel, Charlotte, Samantha, Olivia, and Grace run to the washroom down the hall.

A diamond tiled shower and tub unit takes up most of the space. Next to that stands a stainless steel vanity with a double knob faucet. A rectangular mirror bordered with reclaimed wood clings to the wall above the sink. Three decorative fish towel hooks poke out from behind the door. On the wall opposite the shower, shelving hangs over a white, porcelain toilet. A fuzzy bath mat blankets the area between the toilet and vanity. Kneeling on the bath mat, Nana pulls out a bin from the drawer beneath the sink; she holds it up for the girls to see. Inside a bright array of purple, pink, and blue nail polishes sparkle. 
“Why don’t each of you pick a color,” Nana offers, “and then, come sit and I can paint your fingernails for you,” she says lovingly.
The girls, carefully considering their options, collectively choose to paint their nails the same color: a startling hot pink hue. Grace reads the name stretching across the bottom of the bottle, 
“Make You Blink Pink,” she shouts.
“Oh, good choice,” Nana says as she returns carrying an old beach towel (that will be used to prevent nail polish from staining the bathroom tile). 
Puckered and painted, the girls’ nails are oblivious to the chipping that will soon ensue from the eventful summer days that lie ahead in Antassawamock.
