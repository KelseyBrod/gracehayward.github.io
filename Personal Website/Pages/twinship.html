As a preemie born just over two months early, my petite stature fueled a heightened sense of perseverance and courage within myself. 
Whether out on the field or in the classroom, I was often the tiniest presence and therefore, underestimated. 
Yet, I always felt this strong sense of comfort knowing I was not alone; as an identical twin, I was fortunate enough to see someone else, just like me, defying odds. 
From the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) to now, here at Duke, we’ve gone through life literally and physically side-by-side. 
Being a twin dominates my identity. 
Simply put, I would not be the person I am today without my sister, Olivia. 
While we’ve collectively preached our entire lives about how we are two people, with different personalities and qualities, there is no denying she is—as cliche as it may sound—my other half. 
In fact, the doctors at St. Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, NJ, attributed our successful quick 6-week stay in the NICU to the co-bedding method 
(a practice that involves the placement of two or more multiple-birth infants in the same incubator to replicate the intrauterine environment and ease extrauterine transition). 
Essentially, Olivia and I not only kept each other alive but thrived off of one another. 
As often seen with the co-bedding technique, Olivia, who was considered the more unstable premature twin, displayed signs of improvement in basic functioning like heart rate and sleeping after being placed alongside me. 
Needless to say, my “twinship”, as we both like to call it, significantly defines who I am.</p>

Long before my siblings and I could even walk, our family was participating in the annual St. Barnabas Miracle Walks benefitting the NICU. In high school, I, along with my twin sister and older brother (who also spent time in the NICU following his birth), had the opportunity to serve as a member of the Miracle Walk Teen Advisory Board.  We would meet once a month to brainstorm fundraising ideas and help plan the event. Truthfully, the NICU saved our lives, and my siblings and I could not be more grateful to the doctors, surgeons, and donors associated with the St. Barnabas NICU. Every year, we proudly wear our 'Miracle Baby' shirts and walk with fellow survivors, celebrating those who perservered and honoring those who were taken far too soon.
