<p>On November 6th, 2022, I ran the TCS NYC Marathon as part of the Alzheimer’s Association® Marathon Team. It was the most incredible experience. Many of my earliest and most cherished memories involve running. From trailing my mother's bike down the Mattapoisett Neck Road after begging her to “teach me how to run” to competing for, and eventually leading, the Nobles Girls Varsity Cross Country team my senior year of high school, running has played an integral role in my development as an athlete, leader, and woman. I've found my greatest role models, mentors, and friends through running.

    My high school cross country coach and beloved advisor, Mark Sheeran, made gratitude the foundation of our team. He helped me appreciate that running is far more than a sport, it’s a privilege and a practice that builds community. Most importantly, he taught me the power of running for others; whether it be the people beside you on the trail or the people you run for in spirit. By participating in the NYC Marathon, I committed to raising awareness and $8,000 in funds to advance the care, support, and research efforts of the Alzheimer’s Association. I ran for my Papa (photographed below) and all those who have suffered and are currently suffering from Alzheimer’s disease.  
    
    When I was in third grade, my Papa died of Alzheimer's disease. I watched powerless as his mind and body suffered. I am hopeful that my fundraising will advance a cure such that others are not robbed of a lifetime of memories. Currently, more than 6 million Americans have Alzheimer's disease and that number is expected to grow to nearly 13 million by 2050. We must come together to change the course of this disease; I am thankful that running has given me a method of making a difference.</p>
