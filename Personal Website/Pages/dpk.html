		 <p><center>"The Duke Canine Cognition Center is dedicated to the study of dog cognition. Founded in 2009, it was the first on campus center of its kind in the United States. Our goal is to understand the flexibility and limitations of dog cognition and how it compares to other animals, including our closest living relatives, the great apes.  Doing so can help us understand how our own minds evolved, since over the past decade, we have found that dog and human minds converge in astounding ways. Understanding the dog mind will help us support dogs in their many jobs in society, from being a part of the family, to bomb detection, to assisting people with disabilities."</center></p>

           I started volunteering at the DPK in the Spring of my first year at Duke and returned for my second semester this fall. I work two 2-hour shifts per week. My responsibilities entail walking the puppies, facilitating basic training with the puppies (using specific hand signals and vocal commands), and cleaning up after the puppies. I am required to wear a special vest and name tag while on duty. While the number of volunteers vary by semester, the kindergarten likes to maintain a 1:1 ratio of puppies to volunteers. The bond between the volunteers and puppies grows to be incredibly strong over the course of the semester; it is such a unique experience.
